\format{
A data frame with 1025 observations and 14 variables:
\describe{
  \item{age}{Age of the patient (numeric, in years)}
  \item{sex}{Sex of the patient (factor: 1 = male, 0 = female)}
  \item{cp}{Chest pain type (factor with levels: "1" = Typical Angina, "2" = Atypical Angina,
  "3" = Non-anginal Pain, "4" = Asymptomatic)}
  \item{trestbps}{Resting blood pressure (numeric, in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)}
  \item{chol}{Serum cholesterol (numeric, in mg/dl)}
  \item{fbs}{Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (factor: 1 = true, 0 = false)}
  \item{restecg}{Resting electrocardiographic results (factor: 0 = Normal, 1 = Having ST-T wave abnormality,
  2 = Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)}
  \item{thalach}{Maximum heart rate achieved (numeric)}
  \item{exang}{Exercise induced angina (factor: 1 = yes, 0 = no)}
  \item{oldpeak}{ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (numeric)}
  \item{slope}{Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (numeric: 1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)}
  \item{ca}{Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (numeric, range 0-3)}
  \item{thal}{Thalassemia (factor: 1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)}
  \item{target}{Presence or absence of heart disease (factor: 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease)}

\description{
This dataset originates from the Cleveland Heart Disease database and is used for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients.
The data includes various medical attributes about the patients, and the target variable indicates whether the patient has heart disease (1) or not (0).
}
\details{
The dataset was collected in 1988 and consists of data from several different locations, including Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. For the purpose of most analyses, a subset of 14 attributes is used.
The target field indicates the presence of heart disease: 1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease.
